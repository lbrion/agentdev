1. Chat interface to add tasks to calendar - start of personal assistant
2. Update personal website
3. Auto update website with posts based on latest commits and projects in a human readable format
4. Update social media based on what I did and learned today
    - Manual interface, maybe like typefully, eventually build into more hands free
5. Zwift -> Coros activity automation
    - Browser simulation, check for latest activites, download from Zwift, upload to Coros and rename
6. Pokemon Market Index
    - Take value of some subset of resale pokemon items and see if the overall market is up, down, sideways, etc. to track whether the hype is dying down or provide indication to buy or sell.
